## Abstract

Vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) plays a critical role in chemical and biochemical processes, especially in distillation and separation processes. In binary mixtures like ethanol-water, the prediction of vapor composition (y₁) is essential for optimizing these processes. Azeotropic systems, which exhibit a unique equilibrium where the vapor and liquid compositions are identical, represent a particularly challenging scenario. 

This project focuses on building an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict the vapor composition (y₁) of an ethanol-water binary azeotropic system. The system is trained on experimental and simulated VLE data and tested on its ability to capture azeotropic behavior. This implementation achieves **state-of-the-art performance** with **R² = 0.9956** and **MAE = 0.0135**, providing accurate predictions across diverse thermodynamic conditions including azeotropic behavior prediction.

## Key Features

## Dataset Overview and Preparation

The dataset is synthetically generated using thermodynamic principles and validated against experimental literature data to ensure physical consistency and accuracy. The dataset generation employs **Non-Random Two Liquid (NRTL)** and **UNIQUAC** models, which are industry-standard approaches for VLE prediction of non-ideal systems like ethanol-water.

### Data Sources
- **Experimental Data**: Literature sources supplemented by simulated data using thermodynamic models
- **Validation**: Real-world data validation with Raoult's Law and activity coefficient models for non-ideal mixtures

### Dataset Specifications
- **Data Points**: 500-600 equilibrium data points
- **Features**:
  - **x₁** (liquid mole fraction of ethanol): Range 0.001 to 0.999
  - **T** (Temperature): Range 78°C to 100°C
  - **P** (Pressure): Range 0.5 atm to 2.0 atm

### Sampling Strategy
- Dense sampling near azeotropic composition (x₁ ≈ 0.894)
- Enhanced sampling at composition extremes for ideal/non-ideal behavior capture
- Special attention to azeotropic points where x₁ ≈ y₁

## Model Overview

This artificial neural network (ANN) model predicts vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) compositions for ethanol-water mixtures, specifically focusing on accurately modeling the azeotropic behavior at approximately 89.4% ethanol concentration.

### Network Architecture
- **Deep Feedforward Neural Network** with 5 hidden layers using ReLU activation

### Enhanced Feature Engineering
- **Azeotrope-aware features**: Distance-to-azeotrope measurement and specialized interaction terms
- **Extended interaction terms**: Composition-temperature-pressure cross terms
- **Logit transformation** of composition to handle extreme values
- **Physical parameter incorporation**: Temperature in Kelvin and pressure in kPa

### Custom Loss Function
- **Combined MSE with azeotrope constraint**: Penalizes deviations from y=x behavior near azeotropic point
- **Region-specific weighting**: Stronger constraint within ±0.02 of azeotropic composition (x₁ ≈ 0.894)

### Training Optimization
- **Adam optimizer** with adaptive learning rate (initial: 0.0003)
- **Early stopping** with patience monitoring validation loss
- **Learning rate reduction** on plateau for fine convergence
- **Model checkpointing** to preserve best performing weights
